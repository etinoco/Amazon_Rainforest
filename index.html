                    <p>
                        Brazil is the largest country in South America and the 
                        fifth largest nation in the world. It forms an enormous triangle on the eastern side of the continent with a 4,500 mile
                        (7,400 kilometer) coastline along the Atlantic Ocean. It has borders with every South American country
                        except Chile and Ecuador.

                        The Brazilian landscape is very varied. It is most well known for its dense forests,
                        including the Amazon, the world's largest jungle, in the north. But there are also 
                        dry grasslands (called pampas), rugged hills, pine forests, sprawling wetlands and 
                        a long coastal plains.
